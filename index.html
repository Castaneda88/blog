    <h1>Michael's Web Development Journey</h1>
    <p>Hello world! I've decided to begin a blog in hopes it serves as a helpful resource.
        I will admit, learning web development is something I always found interesting but nothing
        I'd tell anyone I'm passionate about. Albiet, the idea of writing code, or having a skill
        formed in the 21's century has more appeal than medicine or electrical work. By no means am I
        knocking laborous jobs. All I mean is I've always considered it to be interesting.
    <p>I consider it a bonus that web development is a high payinh job. I like that it puts me in front
        of a computer, Provides an outlet for creativity, allows me to produce tools I can use to solve problems,
        amd places me in a place to potentially teach others things I've learned along the way.
    <p>If you're also considering to learn web development, check out <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>
        where you could check out a free to access, community based resource that I'm using to learn both front and back end web developing.
        I've also used <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Code Camp</a>
        Using either one takes things off right away, however, I will say they go in completely different directions.
